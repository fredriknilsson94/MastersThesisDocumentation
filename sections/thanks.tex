After five long and intense years, I am writing the last report during my time at Link\"oping University.
It has been five years of early mornings, late nights and and an uncountable amount of consumed cups of coffee.
Although is has not been a walk in the park, I have almost feelt joy and inspiration every day, because I have been surrounded by amazing and pleasant people.

First of all, I would like to thank Veoneer for given me the oppurtunity to perform my Master's thesis with them.
I would especially like to thank Patrik Leissner, my supervisor at Veoneer, for always being available to answer my questions and for your excellent driving skills when we recored the data sets.
I would also like to thank everyone else at Veoneer who helped me complete this thesis.

Secondly, I would like to thank my supervisor at the university, Per Bostr\"om-Rost, for never beeing more than an email away.
I would also like to give credits to my examiner, Gustaf Hendeby.
He help me to point out the heading of this thesis during the ongoing work and played an important role for finalizing the strcuture of the thesis.
I would also like to mention Gustav Sandvik for helping me to proofread the thesis.

Lastly, I would like to thank everyone that I have meet during my time at Link\"oping University.
You have all helped me to become who I am today.
Especially, my closest friends and family.
You have always supported me and brought so much joy and happiness into my life.
